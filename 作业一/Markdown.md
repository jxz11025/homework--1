### 4.Computer Architecture Layer

> Abstraction
>> to take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use

> Computer architecture overview
>> computers can be cut into four main layers: **hardware**(make up of physical components of a cpmputer), **operating system**(allows hardware to communicate with the system), **software**(how we as humans interact with our computer)and **users**                 

## Hardware

### 1. The modern computer

> Intro to computer hardware
>> ports: connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer

>> **CPU(central Processing Unit)**: the brain of our computer, it does all the calculations and data processing;
**RAM(Random Access Memory)**: our computer's short-term memory;
**Hard drive**: holds all of our data, which includes all of our music, pictures, applications;
**Motherboard**: the body or the circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together

> Program and hardware
>> programs: instructions that tell the computer what to do;  MCC is a bridge between CPU and RAM

> Module Introduction

### 2. Components
